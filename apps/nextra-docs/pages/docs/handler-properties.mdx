# Handler properties

When a CommandKit class has been instantiated, it's easier to refer to the resulting object as the "handler". The `handler` object has properties which will be available throughout the whole project (commands, events, validations, etc) by extracting the `handler` object through the parameters. You'll learn more about this when you setup [commands](/docs/command-file-setup), [events](/docs/event-file-setup) and [validations](validation-file-setup).
