*You are currently looking at the next major version of CommandKit. You can view the `master` branch [here](https://github.com/underctrl-io/commandkit/tree/master)*

CommandKit is a powerful and easy-to-use command and event handler for your Discord.js project. It takes away the hassle of manually registering commands & event listeners, and lets you focus on the core features of your bot. It also offers additional features that make bot development a lot easier such as commands validation, developer-only commands, and permissions validation.

The quickest way to setup a CommandKit project is to use the `create-commandkit` CLI:

```sh
npm create commandkit@next
```
